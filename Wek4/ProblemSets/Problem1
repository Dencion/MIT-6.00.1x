    Returns the score for a word. Assumes the word is a valid word.

    The score for a word is the sum of the points for letters in the

    letters are used on the first turn.

    Letters are scored as in Scrabble; A is worth 1, B is worth 3, C is
    worth 3, D is worth 2, E is worth 1, and so on (see SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES)
